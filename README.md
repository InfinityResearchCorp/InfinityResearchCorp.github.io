# Horizon Mesh Project

**Horizon Mesh Project** - a global, international project aimed at the research of space.

The project is open-source and is dedicated to research the cosmos, developing and building low-cost radio telescopes, exploring new methods of astronomical observation, and researching new technological solutions.

The project will include a [main dynamic website](https://horizonmesh.space/) containing all information about the project, a project forum, a research forum, and its own wiki. It will also provide complete information about how the radio telescopes work, their designs, and schematics to build your own.

The main product of the project will be a network with its own protocols, designed to create a unified, synchronized interferometric array. Radio telescopes will generate samples with precise time stamps from GPSDOs, process the data locally and send it to a central server where synchronization and correlation of all data will be performed to produce a combined result.

The project is currently under development — you can find all information on the website.

## Network launch: no earlier than Q2 2027.

*At the moment, the project is being developed by a single person with a very limited budget. The release dates for the website, software, radio telescope schematics, scientific articles, and the network launch may shift.*

## Donate 

**You can donate money to support the project!**
Due to *sanctions* in my region, I *cannot use or withdraw funds* from platforms such as **Patreon** or **buyMeACoffee**.

**I hope you will support the project!**

### There are two payment methods:

**USDT**: *Сrypto dollar*. A very popular currency, a tokenized form of the dollar. A very convenient currency for donations, as it has low fees. You can use it for ***small donations***. (*~$5 - $10*).

***Important!** Use the Tron (TRC-20) network for transfers in USDT to avoid accidentally losing funds!*

**BTC**: *Bitcoin*. A fairly popular cryptocurrency. But the commission is higher than for *USDT*. You can use it for ***large transfers***. (*~$50 - $100*).

## Wallets

**USDT (TRC-20):** TTHqnyo6seskvbMYu9uAXFWcYsyG1isLbd

**BTC:** bc1qlz8p5l8sy99ldx4n48henmak6h80ad5yy0swkj
